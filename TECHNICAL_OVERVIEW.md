## Valuation Methods Implemented

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models
- **FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity)**: Projects equity cash flows with declining growth rates
- **FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm)**: Values entire firm, then subtracts net debt
- **DDM (Dividend Discount Model)**: Gordon Growth Model for dividend-paying stocks

### 2. Relative Valuation
- **P/E Ratio Analysis**: Comparison to industry benchmarks
- **P/B Ratio Analysis**: Book value multiple approach
- **EV/EBITDA Analysis**: Enterprise value multiples

### 3. Asset-Based Valuation
- **Book Value**: Balance sheet net worth
- **Tangible Book Value**: Excludes intangible assets
- **Liquidation Value**: Conservative asset recovery estimates

### 4. Earnings-Based Methods
- **Capitalized Earnings**: Average earnings approach
- **Earnings Power Value**: Sustainable earnings without growth

## Key Financial Calculations

### Cost of Equity (CAPM)
```
Re = Rf + β(Rm - Rf) + Specific Risk Premium
```

### WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
```
WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1-T))
```

### Terminal Value
```
TV = FCF(terminal) / (WACC - g)
```

### Growth Rate Calculations
- **CAGR**: Compound Annual Growth Rate
- **Fade Model**: High growth declining to terminal rate
- **Multiple Scenario Analysis**: Conservative, base, optimistic

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Financial Risk Factors
- Debt-to-equity ratios
- Interest coverage ratios
- Current ratio analysis
- Cash flow stability

### Business Risk Factors
- Beta coefficient analysis
- Industry cyclicality
- Competitive positioning
- Regulatory environment

### Valuation Risk Factors
- Multiple expansion/contraction
- Growth assumption sensitivity
- Discount rate variations
- Terminal value impact

## Data Requirements

### Essential Financial Data (5+ years)
- Income Statement: Revenue, operating income, net income, EPS
- Balance Sheet: Assets, liabilities, equity, debt, cash
- Cash Flow: Operating, investing, financing activities
- Key Ratios: Profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency

### Market Data
- Current stock price and market cap
- Beta coefficient
- Analyst estimates and ratings
- Industry benchmarks

### Assumptions
- Risk-free rate and market risk premium
- Terminal growth rate (typically 2-3%)
- Tax rates and capital structure
- Reinvestment and payout ratios

## Weighted Valuation Approach

The system calculates a weighted average intrinsic value using:

| Method | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| FCFE | 25% | Primary DCF method for equity value |
| FCFF | 25% | Alternative DCF approach |
| DDM | 15% | Important for dividend-paying stocks |
| P/E Relative | 15% | Market-based validation |
| EV/EBITDA | 10% | Enterprise value perspective |
| Book Value | 5% | Asset-based floor |
| Capitalized Earnings | 5% | Earnings normalization |

## Output Analysis

### Investment Recommendation Logic
- **Strong Buy**: >20% upside, >15% margin of safety
- **Buy**: >10% upside, >10% margin of safety
- **Hold**: >0% upside, >5% margin of safety
- **Sell**: Negative expected returns

### Confidence Levels
- **High**: Low variance between methods (CV < 20%)
- **Medium**: Moderate variance (CV 20-40%)
- **Low**: High variance between methods (CV > 40%)

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Analysis
```bash
# Calculate Caterpillar intrinsic value
npm run calculate

# Calculate specific company
node src/calculate.js CAT

# List available companies
npm run list-companies

# Validate company data
npm run validate CAT
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Get valuation via API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/valuation/cat

# Batch analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/valuation/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tickers": ["CAT", "AAPL"]}'
```

### Adding New Companies
```bash
# Create new company template
npm run create-company AAPL

# Edit data/aapl.json with financial data
# Validate the data
npm run validate AAPL

# Calculate valuation
node src/calculate.js AAPL
```

## Caterpillar Analysis Results

Based on the comprehensive analysis of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT):

**Key Findings:**
- **Current Price**: $413.71
- **Intrinsic Value**: $184.96
- **Recommendation**: Sell (significantly overvalued)
- **Risk Level**: Medium business risk, low financial risk

**Valuation Breakdown:**
- DCF models suggest significant overvaluation
- Relative valuation shows mixed signals
- Strong financial position with excellent cash generation
- High current valuation multiples relative to historical norms
