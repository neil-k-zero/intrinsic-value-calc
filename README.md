# Company Value Calculator

A comprehensive intrinsic value calculator implemented in **Python** that uses multiple valuation methods to determine a company's fair value. This tool implements industry-standard approaches including DCF models, relative valuation, and asset-based methods.

## Features

### Valuation Methods Implemented

#### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models
- **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**: Projects future free cash flows to equity holders
- **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**: Values the entire firm then subtracts debt  
- **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**: For dividend-paying stocks with Gordon Growth Model

#### 2. Relative Valuation Methods
- **P/E Ratio Analysis**: Compare to industry peers and historical averages
- **P/B Ratio Analysis**: Compare market value to book value
- **Enterprise Value Ratios**: EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, EV/EBIT
- **PEG Ratio**: Growth-adjusted P/E analysis

#### 3. Asset-Based Approaches
- **Book Value**: Net worth from balance sheet
- **Liquidation Value**: Estimated liquidation proceeds
- **Replacement Value**: Cost to recreate assets

#### 4. Earnings-Based Methods
- **Capitalized Earnings**: Normalized earnings approach
- **Earnings Power Value**: Sustainable earnings without growth assumptions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses Python standard library)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/company-value-calculator.git
cd company-value-calculator

# Navigate to Python implementation
cd python

# Run a sample calculation
python src/calculate.py
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd python
python src/calculate.py --help
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Calculate Caterpillar (CAT) valuation
python src/calculate.py CAT

# Calculate Apple (AAPL) and save to file 
python src/calculate.py AAPL --save

# List all available companies
python src/calculate.py --list
```

### Calculate Company Value
```bash
# Calculate using pre-loaded company data (default: CAT)
python src/calculate.py

# Calculate specific companies
python src/calculate.py CAT
python src/calculate.py AAPL --save

# List all available companies
python src/calculate.py --list
```

### Add New Company Data
1. Create a new JSON file in `data/` directory (e.g., `aapl.json`)
2. Follow the data structure format shown in `data/cat.json`
3. Run calculations: `python src/calculate.py AAPL`

## Data Structure

Each company data file should include:
- Stock information (ticker, price, shares outstanding)
- Financial statements (5+ years of income, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Market data (beta, risk-free rate, market risk premium)
- Growth assumptions and industry benchmarks

See `data/cat.json` for a complete example and `data/template.json` for the required structure.

## Example Output

The calculator provides:
- **Multiple valuation estimates** from different methods
- **Weighted average intrinsic value** using robust approach
- **Risk assessment** and confidence intervals
- **Detailed breakdown** of each valuation method
- **Recommendation** (Buy/Hold/Sell) with margin of safety

```
